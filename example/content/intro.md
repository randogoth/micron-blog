## Communicate Freely.

The intention with this program is to provide a tool to that allows you to build private and resilient communications platforms that are in complete control and ownership of the people that use them.

Nomad Network is build on LXMF and Reticulum, which together provides the cryptographic mesh functionality and peer-to-peer message routing that Nomad Network relies on. This foundation also makes it possible to use the program over a very wide variety of communication mediums, from packet radio to fiber.

Nomad Network does not need any connections to the public internet to work. In fact, it doesn't even need an IP or Ethernet network. You can use it entirely over packet radio, LoRa or even serial lines. But if you wish, you can bridge islanded Reticulum networks over the Internet or private ethernet networks, or you can build networks running completely over the Internet. The choice is yours.

The current version of the program should be considered a beta release. The program works well, but there will most probably be bugs and possibly sub-optimal performance in some scenarios. On the other hand, this is the best time to have an influence on the direction of the development of Nomad Network. To do so, join the discussion on the Nomad Network project on GitHub.
